# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
This project is dedicated to data structures and algorithms as they relate to
software engineering. In additon to source code, comparisons between the
costs and benefits of each approach are documented. This is an open-knowledge
project.

The structure for this project is straight-forward; topics are separated into
their own packages. For example, `michaelarn0ld.ds_algorithms.arrays` contains
source files related to arrays. Furthermore, documentation and notes on topics
can be found in their respective paths from `/docs`. In the example above,
documentation on arrays would be found in
`/docs/java/michaelarn0ld/ds_algorithms/arrays`
