# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
This project is dedicated to the study of data structures and algorithms as they
relate to software engineering. In additon to source code, comparisons between
the costs and benefits of each approach are documented. This is an
open-knowledge project.

The structure for this project is straight forward; topics are separated into
their own packages. For example, `michaelarn0ld.ds_algorithms.arrays` contains
source files related to arrays. Furthermore, documentation and notes on topics
can be found in their respective paths from `/docs`. In the example above,
documentation on arrays would be found in
`/docs/java/michaelarn0ld/ds_algorithms/arrays`
