# Double Ended Linked Lists
A double ended list is similar to an ordinary linked list except that it has an
additional feature: a reference to the last link (tail) as well as the first link
(head). As a result, the implementation of the double ended list contains an
additional method: `void insertTail(T value)` which inserts a link, containing
data of type T to the end of the list.

For more information about linked lists in general please look at the docs on
`./simple_linked_lists.md`
