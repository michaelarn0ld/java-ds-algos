# Comparing Simple Sorts

* Basically never use Bubble Sort; its only benefit is that it is so easy to
remember that you can implement it off the top of your head

* Selection sort minimizes the number of swaps (N), but the number of comparisons
is still high (N*(N-1)/2). It is useful when swapping data is very time
consuming compared with comparing them

* Insertion sort is the most versatile of the three and is the best bet for
most situations where the data set is small or is almost sorted
